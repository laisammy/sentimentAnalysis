I was elated when my project finally worked, but soon I grew frustrated with the next bug.  
My classmates made me feel appreciated, though I felt anxious before presenting in front of everyone.  
Later, I walked home cheerful, yet a lonely silence filled the flat.  
I became determined to fix my mistakes, even while feeling doubtful about the outcome.  
Still, I ended the day satisfied, thankful for the progress I had made.
