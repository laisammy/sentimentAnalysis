12:40 THEY’RE SONIC RINGS!!

Horror roblox devs when their game isn’t scary enough (volume increase)
BABE WAKE UP NEW FLAMINGO MYTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
14:27 the real horror of this game is waking up in KENTUCKY 😱😱😱

I love how flamingo is getting back into his myth era. I’m sure we’re all happy to see it.
WHO REMEMBERS RUST, CHUCK LOYD, GROCERY GANG, THE ONE ABOUT THE VALLEY
7:45 Albert doesn't know u can walk through the blue and pink, one is correct and one is wrong
7:36 Albert does not realize there’s a pattern and maybe that’s why he keeps dying
1:18 roblox has done this stupid thing where if you say the same thing (even if it isn’t spamming) it automatically tags it and tells you your text chat breaks the rules
MYTH??

THE SMILE FAMILYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
yes
Rust had the BEST plot twist.
DONT FORGET THE SMILES FAMILY
WE remember ALL of them
THATS WHAT I THOUGHT
hes doing it quite literally the hardest possible way  those doors are .5 studs past the ground so its really hard to do this
Hes a bit slow yk
you clearly see him die to both colors
pooguy125 did this btw
​ @zacqonos  Bro has never played an obby before
​ @zacqonos honey it alternates...
​ @zacqonos he literally never died once to the 2 blue blocks meaning those were safe and it altered
I was seething…
@meeboidthemeep-g2pthe fact that he did it anyways is clap worthy tho
@meeboidthemeep-g2p a tier 1 obby player can do this, it's not hard at all it's just his torso, i'm saying this as an obby speedrunner myself
he touched both of the parts on the first one and he died on both o fhtem
He walked on the middle.​ @dakoolkid-d6c 
@Andrew_loves_sharks son nobody cares your flexing that your a “obby pro” this is actually hard to do and not “tier 1”
​@Andrew_loves_sharksi don5 care abt obby stuff but i don't think a. 5 stud stickout is tier 1
almost 20 yrs of roblox n he didnt even think to try that smh. hes going senile
ITS BEEN A BAJILLION YEARS
I am friends with the creator. This was pre-planned.

Flamingo gonna get hacked this time
They might be youtube urls
​​ @mr.ethfono  They were, that one sends you to a music video of I don't know by ERIKA. The next one is a video of this game named: "weird game my dad showed me"
pooguy125 did this btw
flamingos editors certainly arent the best at censoring things, could be one of his passwords
Are they actually password for anyone who actually played
 @elliotepegs7369 The one with VV at the start isn’t actually a password, i played the game and it said the same thing. Not sure about the 2nd “password” one though.
guys are you for real HE'S JOKING 😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏
 @fellacreature obviously it’s not
​​ @galleryeven he was confused by why Albert Aretz said that's his password?
I think the fault lies with you for that one…
How curious…
 @TheBigYosh my fault? i daresay its all thanks to me
Is it perhaps… pallid?
And do not call the Myth's sawnick rings: earrings...
Albert, don’t listen to the voices
11:00 flamingo opened a dark fountain

The real horror is flamingo making the obby harder for himself. Shiftlock makes jumping in the corner of those squares harder and those pink blue walls was pick a door. Jumping past them is almost impossible.. 💔💔😭

The core Five Nights at Freddy's (FNaF) lore revolves around a serial killer, William Afton, his business partner Henry Emily, and the spirits of murdered children who possess the animatronics in a chain of family pizza restaurants. The story is complex and often told through cryptic mini-games, in-game details, and supplementary media like books.  Key Characters William Afton: The primary antagonist, co-founder of Fazbear Entertainment, and a serial killer who murders children and stuffs their bodies into animatronic suits. He eventually gets spring-locked in a suit and becomes the entity known as Springtrap. Henry Emily: William's business partner and a brilliant engineer who designed the original animatronics and "springlock" technology. His daughter, Charlotte, is William's first victim. Michael Afton: William's eldest son, who is guilt-ridden after an accident that kills his younger brother. He later becomes a central protagonist, seeking to undo his father's wrongdoings and free the trapped souls. The Spirits: The souls of the murdered children, including Charlotte (who possesses the Puppet) and Cassidy (who likely possesses Golden Freddy). They are trapped in the animatronics and seek vengeance, often confusing adult night guards for their killer. The Mimic: A newer antagonist introduced in later games, an endoskeleton coded to copy actions, which learns violence from human behavior and continues William's legacy of killing.  Chronological Summary Early 1980s: Fredbear's Family Diner Opens William Afton and Henry Emily open a family restaurant featuring springlock suits that can be worn by humans or function as robots. William kills Henry's daughter, Charlotte, outside the diner. She possesses the Puppet animatronic, who in turn gives life to other murdered children's souls.  1983: The Bite of '83 William's youngest son is tormented by his older brother, Michael, and his friends. As a prank during a birthday party, they shove the young boy's head into Fredbear's mouth. The animatronic's jaw clamps down, crushing the child's head and leading to his death. The diner closes shortly after. 1985: The Missing Children Incident (MCI) At a subsequent location, Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, William lures five more children into a back room while wearing the Spring Bonnie suit and murders them. The children's bodies are hidden inside the main animatronics (Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and Golden Freddy), and their souls begin to haunt the machines. 1987: The Bite of '87 A new location with "Toy" animatronics opens. The animatronics are hostile toward adults due to the spirits haunting them. During a birthday event, a security guard (Jeremy Fitzgerald) has his frontal lobe bitten off by an unnamed animatronic (possibly Mangle). The location closes quickly. Circa 1993: William's Apparent Death The final Freddy Fazbear's Pizza location closes. William returns to the abandoned building to dismantle the original animatronics. The spirits of his victims are freed and chase him into a safe room. In a panic, William hides inside the faulty Spring Bonnie suit, but the springlocks fail, fatally crushing him. His spirit remains trapped in the suit, now known as Springtrap. Circa 2023: Fazbear's Fright and the Pizzaplex Era Michael Afton gets a job at a horror attraction called Fazbear's Fright, which houses the Springtrap suit. Michael burns the building down to try and kill his father, but William survives. Later, Henry Emily lures all the remaining haunted animatronics, including William (now Scraptrap), Michael (who is an undead protagonist after being "scooped" in Sister Location), and his own daughter's spirit, to an underground facility and sets it ablaze to free all the souls. The story then transitions into the modern Security Breach era, focusing on the new Pizzaplex, a digital entity called Glitchtrap, and the Mimic, continuing the cycle of horror and technological evil.

I NEED MORE SCARY MYTH INTERACTIONS
Just wakin up in the mornin gotta thank god
the way he fumblesto get his headphones out during a screamer makes me feel bad lol
wait sarah… AS IN THE VICTIM SARAH FROM SARAHS HOUSE TYCOON
did it ever cross flamingo’s mind that the wraparound jumps would be 10x easier if he just used a body that wasn’t fat
6:55 I am so glad he can still make this voice when saying "Mama"
what a nice video to wake up to
myths are so back with this one
i really hope ROBLOX myth videos come back bro, i really missed amazook and grocery gang and i hope this story continues and albert talks to these guys in more videos
Just woke up at 6am in the morning and a mythical legendary rizzler tuff majestical video dropped 🤑🤑
MYTH??? havent heard that name in years..
9:37 the 3 Y's and the three... oh...
Im glad im not the only one that thought it was a myth game when I saw it earlier on my recommended this week
I was on maximum with headphones 🥹
roblox myths are so back. so nostalgic.
so was this a collective christmas wish or what
Hawk tuah, man!
Place
You ever tried playing The Chauveston Overlook? Honestly one of my favorite modern myths, so much to explore and connect.
albert actually encountering and talking with a roblox myth is not what i was expecting
In the house there’s a double coded paper and it says  “there is nothing, only the end without the meaning, behind the eyes within the memory, between the sin All Fallen”
seeing albert genuinely refuse to use the doors hurt me
i like how a random person was with albert in the rusted trees place
8:06 you did it! One small problem: you did it the wrong way, it was a guessing path, but you choose to wallhop it like an etoh pro.
that reminds me of that one time when that one guy did that one thing
13:40 good one Paige ❤
1:34 the scariest thing ever!!! Ear damage😱😱
Sarah got killed by the stalker btw
nice vid
Omg flamingo my did U post this im s-s-shakeing in my chair!!!! GYATT!
I'm so happy to see you making a new myth videos IT'S BEEN A YEAR BUT HELL YEAHHHHH
I love how were watching this instead of sleeping
Flamingo Myth hunting after years?! And in the conversation between Sarah and Jack, I believe Jacob could be the murderer that they were referring to near Cena's party, and potentially killed Sarah, as she seems unresponsive. Something definitely happened at the party, though, but these are just speculations.
When the game became the red part the music was FIRE 🔥🔥🔥
Finally a video released during morning in my timezone
the fact roblox prevents you from saying any word a few times in a row is genuinely pathetic for the company
20min vid FINALLY... been praying for this
Cool! Now you’re playing myth games again! Now you should play a myth game called excluded.
Duuuude this is just like 2018 this is awesome
0:41 its giving a dream youve had before vibes...
We got a snow day today, and I wake up to a new flamingo video. Peak has been achieved
Im so surprised with how fast this came in my recommendations
I’m so happy these myth videos are back man
15:06 this gameplay reminds me of reprieve
top 10 alcohol brands to drink while driving
flimflam on the grind rn
23 minutes ago is turning me on
i fell asleep to the woman's screams
0:34 I think it says “danger imminent” “don’t turn around” and “I am in front of you”
0:00  that lady looks so kinda you should hug her
I love how the thumbnail look like his old thumbnail
ALBERT PLS PLAY IM NOT A HUMAN PLEASE I BEG
this is actually kinda cool
18:54 broke character 😭
7:55 the fact that he didn't realize it was door picking is genuinely pissing me off 😢
flamango remember how you have the penquin body, THAT GAME SHOULD MADE YOU SMALL SO YOU CAN FLY AT HYPER SPEED MAN
The thumbnail reminds me of the "it lurks" vid!!
flamingo covering myths in the big 2025 🥹
Thanks flamingo for another video!
These games just get more annoying and loud and less scary 🫩💔🥀
mythical refresh pull....
Yoooooo you are NOT welcome.
⁠yeah
Mf joined 40 minutes ago just to sponsor pron pretty solid

Nothing is better than waking up yo a flamingo video
I love my favorite half of jalbert!!
alberts the type of person who would make a funeral funny
finally another myth video i've been fed
When will cleetus regular form return 😭
5:50 LMFAOOOOO
Holy crap finally more myths stuff❤🌹
I love this returning myth content ❤
what a shock
if your gonna start doing myth videos again, please do a roblox myth called ForfietingStruggle, it seems interesting
"forest" hitss hard
7:56 hey Albert, you were meant to walk through those some of them can be walked through without dying
Hey Albert, Crimson Chronicles is working on to add Cleetus(aka you) has the killer of the game,his appearence is that he has some Substances that Goner has, also making his hat having horns,and a yellow eerie eye, i recomend you play it, it might make the game be famous once you play it, because the algorythm has never heard or ignores the game,they also has cool OSTs! You obviously should give it a try
ah, myths... haven't heard that word in a while...
does anyone remember the flamingo/albertsstuff video when albert is reading some kid’s chat bubble on tremity’s adopt and raise a cute kid? he was watching these two kids in their house and the boy said “we were playing t or d” and albert read it as “tuh or duh” if you have the link or the title please let me know i’ve been searching for so long 🙏
I was just about to sleep and saw this mythical video
Myths? That shi give me some nostalgia
guts and blackpowder music mentioned🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
broski finally uploads another myth video after years
Gone.. Return to dust and ash. Albert watch out. :)
HE HAS RETURNED TO THE MYTH ERA!
Albert is more disturbed by the obby than the myth instead
when i hear the word myth so i genuinely hit a flow state
We are sooooo back
THANK U FOR UPLOADING KINGGG
Missed the myths so much
at like 7:42 my brain was literally screaming "just try the other side for once"
Myths..... Haven't heard that in a few years.
The word myth brings back a multitude of fond memories
I think this has to do something with Sarah's house tycoon. Hmmmm....
Boy oh boy i love that hes back to myths
Okay, in all realness im so hyped for this myth, MORE VIDS TO COME PLEASE
I wonder how many login attempts flamingo have got?
this myth sounds so intresting
YO I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE VISIT7 OUT WE HAD A WHOLE GROUP AND IM SO HAPPY FLAMINGO DID A VIDEO ON IT NO WAY
This guy is still helping me feel not depressed 5 years later
0:03 "visit7's place!" very loud screeching
last time it was an admin abuse video, now a myth video?? is this heaven??
Thank you a lot for releasing this at 1 am
Well the start interestingly started off well...
This is beautiful 😂
I’m so happy there’s more myth’s to see >:)
the corner 💀
roblox myth, well that sounds familiar doesn't it
this reminds me of myths so much...
When I hear the word myth so I lowkey reach flow state
0:08 very hot looking avatar
myths are baaaaaack
11:07 buddy u think its gonna move in the air???
Hola hola hola e  spese papa YOUR TEARING APART
WE USED TO PRAY FOR TIMES LIKE THESE  fr though I hope these are actual myths and not just "here's a creepy game for my edgy oc!!"
THE MYTHS WERE MY CHILDHOOD
The fact my irl name is Jacob.
4:50 i can't wait to see flamingo rage on EToH loll
myth… gee I haven’t heard that in a long time
This reminds me of the good ol' days of flamingo exploring myths, I love this
So this is still continuing? I love it.
whenever Flamingo says the word Myth or makes a video about a Myth an angel grows its wings
I miss when myth/myth games had a slight goofy charm to them and weren't just "LOOK GUYS! I WATCHED MANDELA CATALOG! I KNOW WHAT GOOD HORROR IS SEE?!"
We need more Roblox myths Albert😌
Wow,the thumbnail looks sooo wholesome. im sure nothing spooky or bad will ever happen
28 minutes ago is toe tickling
i used to pray for times like this
finally, a good myth after chuck floyd and smiles
7:35 ur tail. It has collision thats why, its touching the bricks!
It looks like one of those series like rust010
The word myth sends me into a frenzy i miss it please
It means your characyer model has been deleted means ur avatar. 2:52
Dude this might be Sarah from Sarahs house tycoon thingy
Imma walk my pet fish…   He died 🗿
Oh my god Albert is back into myth hunting, there’s SO MANY new myths you should try out!!! 👀👀
Flamingo, there's a game called Our Sanctuary and when it becomes public I'll be a knight in it which I think they have admins and it's really weird but you should investigate it. I'll ask DecayingBlossom when it will be open so PLEASE FLAMINGO MY MAMA KINDA HOMELESS PLEASE INVESTIGATE 😢😢😱😱😱😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
i went offroad at crashed into a school on the way back home after using my supersonic hearing to detect a new flamingo intro 200 universes away
I PRAYED FOR TIMES LIKE THESE
Does this mean that Roblox myths is back?
This is like waking up to Christmas early
FLAMINGO ACTUALLY MYTH HUNTING AGAIN?!?! WAITER WAITER! MORE MYTH VIDEOS!!!
albert doing myth stuff again???? Yippee!!!
Imagine when he does the commands at the top, it just says "good boy"
6:16 those craws from silksong
7:41 ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THIS HARD ALBERT💔💔
Thats a word i havent heard for years...
Halloween is over for these type of videos Albert🙏 Im grateful for these videos tho
Nah she just wants a hug
The myth community has been summoned once more
Flamingo doing a myth video again is like seeing an ex
Oil up for mommy. Qlbert.
Myths? It's been a while since I've heard that..
so cute i need to play this game
14:26 YEEE HAW WE GOT SOME KENTUCKY REPRESENTATION
Yooo the good old days of the smiling family house myth  Also morse code in the end someone translate that
Very funny and entertain video  can't wait for more 🔥❤️
Why does he throw his head back like that and expect me to stay calm and composed
MORE PLEEEAAEEE OMGG MOOOREEE FEED US PAPA FLAMINGO FEED US MYTHS PAPA PLSSSS
11:28 reminds me of rust 010s “the sunken place”
MYTHS OMFG YESSSSS
18:53 i would be shocked too if i saw mrfleemflame in game
I watched this with headphones FULL volume and I think I’m ok
woke up to late 💔
I love flamingos new avatar it's very pleasant
vessel..? THE PURE VESSEL??? 5:54
1:02 it kinda looks like herobirne lol but dark
albert back in his myth era
45 MINOOTS
hello
albert and his yearning to bring the myth community back 😞
how DARE youtube hide this from me for 1 hour
whos gonna tell him its one of those guessing walls
I liked when myths were actually interesting, and not just random images flashing on your screen with loud jumpscares
albert posting a roblox myth? i must be in heaven
It’ll get worse when that guy comments on this video when he sees it I’ll be genuinely terrifying😭
SAY YOU SWEAR THERES A MYTH VIDEO… IM HALFWAY THROUGH HIS MYTH PLAYLIST
I’m enjoying the late night posts
Dude the prophecy is coming through the myth of flamingo is happening rn
This was genuinely soo creepy😭🙏
i have not heard flamingo title with myth in years... WE ARE SO BACK
YOU SHOULD PLAY A LONG HIKE!!!!
I've never been happier
The worst roblox update we all thought that it was good when it wasn't in the first place. Chat moderation... Roblox should maybe make at least spamming more forgieable unless if it is not like links  but only chat yes. 11:44
this reminds me of ocean terror
Hi Flamingo
9:40 Mandela catalog neuron activation 👀
I thought flamingo was just exploring a creepy game but then i realized that its myth after such a  long time
yes more myths .. give me more albert.
NON EXISTING GIRLFRIEND WAKE UP ALBERT JUST POSTED A VIDEO
The myth community has been dying out lately, I'm so happy that this video might give it a boost 😭
Himeno treatment
I was just watching his older videos lol
I used to pray for times like this
ah yes, uploading at 2:30am, thank you for feeding us insomniacs albert
