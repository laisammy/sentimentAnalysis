This project was built by following builtwithpython's tutorial on Sentiment Analysis with NLTK Python.
[Sentiment Analysis with/without NLTK Python](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhTjy8cBISEoOtB5_nwykvB9wfEDscuEo&si=VqrmxPbgKR229Hha)

In the tutorial, sentiment analysis is demonstrated using Twitter data. For my own version of this project, I replaced Twitter data with YouTube comments and I built a custom dataset by scraping YouTube comments and used those comments as the text input for analysis.
